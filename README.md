# boot-classic-test
Spring Boot app with some autogenerated docs (OpenAPI) and basic Docker usage. 

To run the app, just activate start.bat (for Win users) or start.sh (for Unix-like users). Of course, Docker should be installed.

It accepts a POST-request for the /core-api/logs endpoint and adds the logs to the Postgre database and file.
You can see the docs for API at /core-api/swagger-ui/index.html.
